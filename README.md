## Project Description

In everyday life, humans are particularly attuned to listening to two
particular types of sound: speech and music. We apply a novel analysis method
to shed light on how the brain is almost effortlessly able to use acoustic
features to assign meaning to sounds. To do so, we use an original
cross-validated Representational Similarity Analyses (RSA) approach implemented
in Matlab to estimate the similarity between acoustic or semantic features of
an auditory stream (speech, music) and neural activity (here intracranial EEG
recordings decomposed into frequency bands).
